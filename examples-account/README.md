## IOTA Identity Account Examples

This folder provides code examples for you to learn how the IOTA Identity WASM bindings for the Account can be used in JavaScript/Typescript.

The examples are written in Typescript and can be run independently with Node.js.

### Node.js

In order to run the examples in Node.js make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


And build the bindings:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then run the example using:

```bash

npm run example:account -- <example-name>
```

For instance, to run the `create_did` example use:

```bash
npm run example:account -- create_did
```

## Browser

Although the examples should work in browser environment, we don't provide a browser project as for now.
