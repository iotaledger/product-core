/**
 This example shows how to revoke a verifiable credential.
 It demonstrates two methods for revocation. The first uses a revocation bitmap of type `RevocationBitmap2022`,
 while the second method simply removes the verification method (public key) that signed the credential
 from the DID Document of the issuer.

 Note that this example uses the "main" network, if you are writing code against the test network then most function
 calls will need to include information about the network, since this is not automatically inferred from the
 arguments in all cases currently.
