    This example shows a basic introduction on how to create a basic DID Document and upload it to the Tangle.
    A ED25519 Keypair is generated, from which the public key is hashed, becoming the DID.
    The keypair becomes part of the DID Document in order to prove a link between the DID and the published DID Document.
    That same keypair should be used to sign the original DID Document.
