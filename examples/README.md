## IOTA Identity Examples

This folder provides code examples for you to learn how the IOTA Identity WASM bindings can be used in JavaScript.

If you are writing code against the test network then, most function calls will need to include information about the
network, since this is not automatically inferred from the arguments in all cases currently.

We recommend that you **always** use a `CLIENT_CONFIG` parameter that you define when calling any functions that take a
`ClientConfig` object. This will ensure that all the API calls use a consistent node and network throughout. If you
mismatch the network across calls you will encounter errors.

A `ClientConfig` is a record consisting of two string fields: `network` and `node`. There is an example client config
that can be found in the `config.js` file for node and in `main.js` for the browser.

### Node.js Examples

Before running the examples, make sure you have [built the bindings](../README.md#Build) for `node.js`.

You can run each example using

```
npm run example:node -- <example_name>
```

For Instance, to run the example `create_did`, use

```
npm run example:node -- create_did
```

The following examples are currently available:

|  #  | Name                                | Information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :-: | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | [create_did](node/create_did.js)         | Generates and publishes a DID Document, the fundamental building block for decentralized identity.                                                                                                                                         |
|  2  | [manipulate_did](node/manipulate_did.js) | Add verification methods and service endpoints to a DID Document and update an already existing DID Document.                                                                                                                              |
|  3  | [diff_chain](node/diff_chain.js)     | Creates a diff chain update for a DID Document and publishes it to the Tangle.                                                                                                                                                             |
|  4  | [resolve_history](node/resolve_history.js) | Advanced example that performs multiple diff chain and integration chain updates and demonstrates how to resolve the DID Document history to view these chains.                                                                          |
|  5  | [create_vc](node/create_vc.js)           | Generates and publishes subject and issuer DID Documents, then creates a Verifiable Credential (VC) specifying claims about the subject, and verifies it.                                                                                  |
|  6  | [create_vp](node/create_vp.js)           | Create a Verifiable Presentation, the data model for sharing VCs, out of a Verifiable Credential and verifies it.                                                                                                                          |
|  7  | [revoke_vc](node/revoke_vc.js)           | Remove a verification method from the Issuers DID Document, making the Verifiable Credential it signed unable to verify, effectively revoking the VC.                                                                                      |
|  8  | [resolution](node/resolution.js)         | Resolves an existing DID to return the latest DID Document.                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  9  | [merkle_key](node/merkle_key.js)         | Adds a MerkleKeyCollection verification method to an Issuers DID Document and signs a Verifiable Credential with the key on index 0. Afterwards the key on index 0 is deactivated, making the Verifiable Credential fail its verification. |



### Browser Examples
All the Node.js examples are also available for the browser.

Before running the examples, make sure you have [built the bindings](../README.md#Build) for `web`.

You can run the browser examples using

```
npm run example:browser
```
Note: The webpage will be served on port 8080
