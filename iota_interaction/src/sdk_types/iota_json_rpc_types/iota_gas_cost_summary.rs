/// Summary of gas charges.
///
/// Storage is charged independently of computation.
/// There are 3 parts to the storage charges:
/// - `storage_cost`: it is the charge of storage at the time the transaction is
///   executed. The cost of storage is the number of bytes of the objects being
///   mutated multiplied by a variable storage cost per byte
/// - `storage_rebate`: this is the amount a user gets back when manipulating an
///   object. The `storage_rebate` is the `storage_cost` for an object minus
///   fees.
/// - `non_refundable_storage_fee`: not all the value of the object storage cost
///   is given back to user and there is a small fraction that is kept by the
///   system. This value tracks that charge.
///
/// When looking at a gas cost summary the amount charged to the user is
/// `computation_cost + storage_cost - storage_rebate`
/// and that is the amount that is deducted from the gas coins.
/// `non_refundable_storage_fee` is collected from the objects being
/// mutated/deleted and it is tracked by the system in storage funds.
///
/// Objects deleted, including the older versions of objects mutated, have the
/// storage field on the objects added up to a pool of "potential rebate". This
/// rebate then is reduced by the "nonrefundable rate" such that:
/// `potential_rebate(storage cost of deleted/mutated objects) =
/// storage_rebate + non_refundable_storage_fee`
