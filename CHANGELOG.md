## [wasm-v0.5.0-dev.3](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/wasm-v0.5.0-dev.3) (2022-01-25)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/compare/wasm-v0.5.0-dev.2...wasm-v0.5.0-dev.3)
 
This release introduces a breaking change for diff updates created by versions `v0.5.0-dev.1` and `v0.5.0-dev.2` (previous diff updates from `<=v0.4.0` are already incompatible due to breaking changes to the document and message structure in `v0.5.0-dev.1`). To migrate, please publish an integration update containing all diff changes to prevent unexpected changes to resolved DID Documents.

### Changed

- Add union type parameters [\#616](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/616)
- Fix dependent diff updates being rejected [\#605](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/605)
- Remove JSON string escaping in diff messages [\#598](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/598)

### Patch

- Use node-fetch \>= 2.6.7 [\#617](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/617)
- Fix diff properties \(de\)serialization [\#611](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/611)

## [wasm-v0.5.0-dev.1](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/tree/wasm-v0.5.0-dev.1) (2021-12-15)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/compare/wasm-v0.4.0...wasm-v0.5.0-dev.1)
 
This release introduces multiple breaking changes to the structure of IOTA DID Documents and their Tangle messages, rendering any identity created with a prior version incompatible and unresolvable. A versioning system has been introduced so any new identities should hopefully be forward compatible with any future breaking changes to the message structure.

- Refactor document metadata [\#540](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/540)
- Replace `chrono` with `time` [\#529](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/529)
- Rename `DocumentDiff` to `DiffMessage` [\#511](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/511)
- Deterministic ordering of competing messages [\#506](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/506)
- Check for existence & duplication of methods in `CoreDocument` [\#504](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/504)
- Annotate Wasm async function return types [\#501](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/501)
- Add `ExplorerUrl` to replace `Network` explorer methods [\#496](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/496)
- Update `ServiceEndpoint` to support sets and maps [\#485](https://github.com/iotaledger/identity.rs/pull/485)
