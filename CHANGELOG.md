This release introduces multiple breaking changes to the structure of IOTA DID Documents and their Tangle messages, rendering any identity created with a prior version incompatible and unresolvable. A versioning system has been introduced so any new identities should hopefully be forward compatible with any future breaking changes to the message structure.
