  /// `Resolver::resolveCredentialIssuer` can help extract the latest available state of the issuer's DID Document.

  /// `credentialStatus`, `type`, `credentialSchema`, `refreshService`, **and more**.
  /// These should be manually checked after validation, according to your requirements.

  /// ### Errors
  /// An error is returned whenever a validated condition is not satisfied.
